# Adopt this VM's identity from the Firecracker metadata service — run INSIDE
# the guest, installed + enabled by warm.sh so it is ALIVE (mid-loop) in the
# RAM the warm bake freezes. Every clone restored from that golden wakes with
# the golden's identity in RAM and an UNTOUCHED disk (the host must never
# mutate a warm clone's disk offline — the frozen page cache has to keep
# matching it), so the identity arrives over the one channel that is per-clone
# and cache-safe: MMDS at 169.254.169.254 (provision-vm.py stages the payload;
# vm-restore.py PUTs it before resume, and the cold-boot fallback preloads it
# via the launcher's --metadata).
#
# The loop: poll MMDS once a second; when it serves an identity whose uuid
# differs from the one this disk last adopted (/etc/atlas-vm-uuid), apply it —
# fresh SSH host keys FIRST (so the controller's first successful connection
# already sees the new identity), then machine-id/hostname/authorized_keys and
# the on-disk network env (so a later plain reboot of the clone comes up
# correctly), and the live network LAST (bringing the clone's addresses up is
# what makes it reachable, i.e. the externally visible "freshen done" signal).
# /etc/atlas-vm-uuid is written at the very end as the applied marker.
#
# On the golden at bake time MMDS is empty, so the loop idles — exactly the
# frozen state a restore should wake into. Stdlib only; logs go to journald.
